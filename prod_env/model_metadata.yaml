# The model names here should match the model names in model_deployments.yaml.

# If you want to add a new model, you can technically do it here but we recommend
# you to do it in prod_env/model_metadata.yaml instead.

# Follow the template of this file to add a new model. You can copy paste this to get started:
#    # This file contains the metadata for private models
#    models: [] # Leave empty to disable private models
